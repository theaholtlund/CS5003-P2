# Emojitar Maker

The programn allows a user to generate an emojitar, with features of their choice.

### Description

The emojitar prgram is an application for generating emojitars based on individual emojitar components, and displaying them in a preview box before saving them to a backend server. It also allows user to register and log in to the service.

### Running the program

Running and interacting with the web application also **requires Node.js and Express.js.** Having Node.js installed, the package manager NPM is used to install Express.js by running the command:
```bash
npm install express
```

Based on Node.js and the npm packet manager, a user must **start the server from the terminal** before the application can return any useful outputs. Starting the server from the terminal can be done by running the command:
```bash
npm start
```

This command will trigger the execution of the `package.json` start script "nodemon backend.js", which has been implemented to restart the server on save for ease of developing the program.
